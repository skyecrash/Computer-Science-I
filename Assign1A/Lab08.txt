// Efficiency practice program
// This document has three cases that represent portions of programs
// that need some help; they are inefficient.
// Study the code and rewrite or remove portions of the code
// to make it more efficient. Your goal should be to decrease the number 
// of units (operations) by as much as possible. 
// We will assume a fictional chip where everything takes one cycle.

// UNITS:

// Mathematics (1 cycle)
// Assignment (1 cycle)
// Logical operations such compare operations, etc… (1 cycle)
// Return (1 cycle)
//  Hint: simply update this code for your answer by removing 
//  the operations (code) that you find to be inefficient (unnecessary)...
//
//
// CASE 1
// Assume all variables and constants were defined, etc.
// This should be an easy one (short and sweet too)

   for (i = 0; i < max; i++)
      myArray[i] += sqrt(PI/2); 

//
//	  
// CASE 2
// A function that should make you wince

int findHighest(double s1,double s2,double s3,double s4,double s5)
 {
    double score = (s1 > s2) ? s1 : s2;
	score = (score < s3) ? s3 : score;
	score = (score < s4) ? s4 : score;
    return ((score < s5) ? s5 : score);
 }

//
// 
// CASE 3
// A naïve program (hint: is maybe k totally useless?)
//                        if so, all the instructions are too. 
//                  look for similar useless code and counters...
